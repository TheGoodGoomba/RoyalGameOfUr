## Rules
The Royal Game of Ur is a race game, similar to it's more modern decendant, Backgammon. The aim of the game is to go off with all seven of your pieces.

The game is played with four four-sided (D4) dice. On each die, two of the verticies are marked.
When rolling, the player whose turn it is rolls all four dice, and the value of their roll is the number of marked corners that are facing up.
Each die has a 50% chance of a 1 and a 50% chance of a 0. For any roll of all four dice, the maximum roll is a 4 and the minimum roll is a 0.

The path each player takes is shown in the below diagram. The middle strip of the board is disputed territory, and both players go down it.
Each player has four of their own squares at the start and two more at the end of their path that they move down.

To start their turn, a player rolls all four dice and can move any one of their pieces that number of squares forward along their path.
At the beginning of the game, all pieces are off the board. To put a piece on the board, a player can put it on the corresponding square number from the start.
E.g., if the player rolls a 2, they can place a new piece on the second square from the start of the path.

If a player can move, they must. A player may choose whether to use their dice roll to place a new piece on the board or to move a piece already on it.
If your move ends with a piece landing on a square marked with a rosette (the flower-looking things), they roll and move again.

In the disputed territory, one player may kick another player's piece off the board by landing on it. However, a piece on the rosette in the middle of the board is safe.

To go off, a player must roll the exact number of squares until the end of the path plus 1.

## In Game

Players follow the on-screen instructions to play. In the console, pieces are represented by coloured rectangles and rosette spaces are represented by asterisks.
The value of the dice throw is shown under the board, at the right.
Under the board at the left is each player's number of pieces not on the board, and the number that have gone off by reaching the end.

When you roll, letters appear in the spaces where pieces can be placed on the board, and on pieces that can be moved.
A move is made by typing the letter corresponding to the move the player wants to make.
